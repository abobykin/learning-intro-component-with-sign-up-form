## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - Vue framework (Version 3+)
- [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/) - VeeValidate - library for forms validation
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) - Bulma - UI framework
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS - CSS extension

### What I learned

I've learned how to validate Vue3 forms nicely and easily, a bit about Vue reactivity and lazy validation, VeeValidate npm library is really helpful to make it even more simple than on native Vue.js framework!
